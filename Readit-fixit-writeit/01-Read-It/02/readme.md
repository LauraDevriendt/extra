* Open index.html in your browser. What is the difference between this and the previous example?
* Do you notice a difference between the 2 document.write lines?
    * answer: the difference isn't in the display but in the way of concatenation. The second options uses template literals which is way easier when you have a lot you want to write into the document. You can also use placeholders ${}which make it possible to use functions.
* Look at the 'Template literals' documentation
