## EX 09
* Notice how the 2 map functions are attached to eachother, this is called 'method chaining'
    * first map: new array with movies in lower or upper case
    * second map: array of list items
    * array converted to string (ordered list created)
    * writed to the document 

* What does the parseTitle function do exactly?
    * takes title as parameter (title is set to lowercase)
    * if the title starts with "the" then the output in the console will be "film met THE: title" and finally the title is set toUpperCase and is returned. 
    if the title DOESN't start with "the" than you just return the title in lowercase
    * the return is used in the other functions
* Notice how all the code is in the shape of functions.
