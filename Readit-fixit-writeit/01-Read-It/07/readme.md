* Look at the documentation of the map() function
* What's the difference between this and the previous exercise?
    * the map function works a bit like the filter function. 
    * So in this example the map functions is run on the movies array and saved in a contstant lowerCaseMovies. The map function makes an new array of all the movies in lowercase.
    * and then on this new array (const lowerCaseMovies) the foreach loop is executed the same way as in the previous excercise except the lowercase transformation is already done.
