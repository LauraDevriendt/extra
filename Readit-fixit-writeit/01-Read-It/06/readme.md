## EX 06
* Notice the difference with the previous exercise. What changed?
    * The difference is that we don't use a for loop but a forEach loop that is often used when we have arrays. So for each movie we will use an arrow function which writes to the documents the output of the wrapWithTag function that uses the parameters, moviesname in lowercase and the li tag 
    * the wrapWithTag arrow function uses template literals and placeholders to make a list item of a movies that comes out of the foreach loop
