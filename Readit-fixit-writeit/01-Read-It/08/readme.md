* Look at the documentation of the join() function. Explain how it is used here.
    * the join function returns a string from the array movies by concatenating all of the elements
    * So in this case: 
        1. the lowercaseMovies is a new array by the map function of the movies in lowercase
        1. From these ones is a new array made with the map function where we use the wrap with tag function so we have an array of listitems with movies 
        1. the array is converted to a string and places between ol tags
