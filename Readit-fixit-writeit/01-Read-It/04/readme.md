## EX 04
* Open script.js and read the code. What do you think will happen. Try to explain in your own words.
    * the movies will be output in a ordered list by using a for loop. However the last movies will not be in the output due to the fact that the loop continues till i is smaller than the complete number of movies used in the array.

    <!-- *  WATCH OUT the index starts on 0 while length starts on 1 in this case -->
